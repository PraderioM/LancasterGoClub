  The most commonly played variant of Go is usually played in an initially empty 19x19 board and the goal
  is that of getting more territory than your enemy. The concept of territory is however a bit difficult to understand
  if you have never played before and a 19x19 board can feel intimidating at first. That is why, for your first games,
  we recommend you to play an easier and faster to play variant named <i>Capture Go</i>. Here are the 5 things you need
  to know in order to play.

  <h4 class="w3-wide">1) <u>Setup</u></h4>
  Each player chooses a color (black or white) and takes all stones of that color. Then you start the game on an empty
  9x9 board with the configuration shown below.

  </p>

  <h4 class="w3-wide">2) <u>Placing stones</u></h4>
  Black plays first. Black and white take turns placing one stone at a time on an empty <b>intersection</b> (not in the squares!).
  Once a stone is played it <b>cannot</b> be moved. Stones can also be placed in the intersections of corners and edges.

  <h4 class="w3-wide">3) <u>Liberties of groups</u></h4>
  Stones of the same color that touch each other <b>along a line</b> form a <i>group</i>. The  intersections connected
  to a group <b>along a line</b> are called it's <i>liberties</i>.
  <br>
  There are 8 groups in the picture below. 6 of them have their liberties drawn and counted can you do the remaining 2?

  </p>

  In the picture below there are 7 different groups, all numbered, can you find the liberties of each group?

  </p>

  <h4 class="w3-wide">4) <u>Capturing</u></h4>
  As soon as a group of stones has no liberties that group is <b>captured</b> and removed off the board. Note that a
  stone can be placed where it has no liberties as long as, by doing so, it captures the opponent.
  <br>
  Each black group below on the left only has one liberty! see what happens when white fills the last liberty (right).

  <h4 class="w3-wide">5) <u>How to win</u></h4>

  The winner is the first player to capture one or more stones.
